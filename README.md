# NextJS Smart Contract Lottery (Full Stack / Front End)

## Introduction
This project is a hands-on implementation of a Smart Contract Lottery system, with a front end developed using React.js and NextJS. As part of my learning journey in Patrick Collins' course, this application not only allows users to connect their wallets and participate in a lottery but also displays real-time contract data such as participant addresses, last winners, and the total amount in the lottery pool.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with React.js and NextJS, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Wallet Connection**: Enables users to easily connect their wallets to participate in the lottery.
- **Real-Time Contract Data**: Displays up-to-date information from the smart contract, including participant details, previous winners, and lottery pool amount.
- **IPFS Hosting**: The front-end is hosted on IPFS, ensuring decentralized and efficient access.


## Technology Stack
- **Front End**: React.js, NextJS
- **Blockchain**: Solidity
- **Hosting**: IPFS

## Acknowledgements
A special thanks to Patrick Collins for his invaluable guidance through his course, which was crucial in the development of this project and my understanding of full-stack blockchain development.
